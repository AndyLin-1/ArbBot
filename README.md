## Introduction

Arbitrage Bot (ArbBot) is a Discord bot designed to access betting odds from popular sportsbooks such as bet365, DraftKings, and FanDuel. It provides users with the best odds available from these sportsbooks and, in rare cases, identifies arbitrage opportunities where users can profit by betting on both sides of an event.

In addition to arbitrage opportunities, the bot also offers a feature to help users maximize their free bet conversions. Many sportsbooks offer free bets in the form of bet credits, and ArbBot scrapes the odds to provide users with the best conversion lines for specified amounts and sportsbooks.
