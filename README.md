Arbitrage Bot (ArbBot) is a discord bot that accesses betting odds from popular sportsbooks such as bet365, draftking, and Fanduel. Using these odds
the bot then gives you the best odds of each site. In rare cases the bot will even give an arbitrage line such as the one below

Meaning if you bet both sides, you will end up in profit no matter what.

But since arbitrage lines are rare occurences where sportsbooks don't see the correct odds, another feature of the bot is to give you the best freebet 
conversions. Many sportsbooks offer you money in the form of bet credits, allowing you to essential bet on a event for free, but since it's not real money
you would need to profit to convert it. ArbBot scrapes the odds and gives you the best conversion line for the specified amount and sportsbook as seen below
